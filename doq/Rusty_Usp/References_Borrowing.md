# References & Borrowing

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{s1}' is {len}.");
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because s does not have ownership of what
  // it refers to, the String is not dropped.
````

- ```&String```- these ampersands represent *references*, and they allow you to refer to some value <u>without taking ownership</u> of it.

```rust
fn main() {

    change(&s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
